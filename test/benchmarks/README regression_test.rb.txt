About the `regression_test.rb` Script
=====================================

This Ruby command line script implements the requirement described in
README.txt and serves as a good example of a regression testing application
for HTML Tidy. Complete documentation on how to use the script can be seen
by invoking the script in your terminal: `./regression_test.rb` (or the
equivalent on your OS).

Prerequisites
=============

1. Install Ruby on your system if not already installed.

2. Install the bundler gem if not already installed: `gem install bundler`
   It may be necessary to use `sudo` or run as an administrator, as appropriate
   to your OS.
   
3. In your terminal `cd` into the `benchmarks/` directory.

4. `bundle install` to make sure the script's dependencies are met.

5. `./regression_test.rb` (or your OS' equivalent) for usage instructions.
